The second one it's a diagram that shows the design for the users and its roles. It is mainly for the administration page.

## Relational diagrams and basic structure

After the ER Diagrams it was time for the design of the logical part of the database. I tried to did it as simple as possible but always focusing on what really makes

The user part is not very complex. It doesn't differ much from the rest.
