## Menu

When you start the game you can see the main menu of the game with multiple options. The first one is 'Start Game', and it's very self-explanatory: it will start the game.
The second one is the 'Settings' menu, and the last one is for exiting the game.

If you click in options you can see that you can change the movement inside the game. The continuous movement allows you to move like in a normal game with the joysticks. The 
teleport option allows you to move with a teleportation movement. The continuous movement can be produce dizziness if you are not used to VR, but the teleportation movement can
avoid that, and is recommended for new VR players.
