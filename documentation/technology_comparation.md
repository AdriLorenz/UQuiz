## Server

The server has been created with **NodeJs** with Javascript among other dependencies like **express**, **passport** and **Sequelize** as the ORM. Why NodeJs? 
NodeJs is a powerful and versatile backend framework that meet all the requeriments that the project needs: a functional backend fast enough to allow websockets to work as fast
as posible. 

Its flexibility allow us to do everything needed in order for the project to reach our objectives, and also is a useful framework that allow us to test everything and learn much faster.

## Administration Page

At first, the administration page was made with a embedded library for NodeJS called EJS, but it was somekind of limited. As the project became bigger we needed something more flexible to use, so we decided to use Angular instead. Angular allowed us to made a bigger administration page, more organized, with cleaner code, and to have more control on everything.

## Game

The game used the mighty Unity. It is a powerful game engine, more simple than its competitors and is always introducing new useful features. Perfect for beginners in games development.
Its direct competitor, Unreal Engine, is probably more powerful than Unity, but is a little bit more complex and as a student I need it to be more easy to understand.

With **Unity** I have a game engine that allow me to do everything as simple as possible: 3D modeling, programming with C#, scripts, audio desing, lighting, etc.
