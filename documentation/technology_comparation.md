## Server

The server has been created with **NodeJs** with Javascript among other dependencies like **express**, **passport** and **Sequelize** as the ORM. Why NodeJs? 
NodeJs is a powerful and versatile backend framework that meet all the requeriments that the project needs: a functional backend fast enough to allow websockets to work as fast
as posible. 

Withing NodeJs, I used **.EJS** for the administation page. The page dont need to support high traffic or being exceptionally organized, I just needed it to work (at the end, it's just
an administration page for administrators to create the questions and register users. 

If the project needed web pages more client-oriented the use of Angular or React, for example, would be more efficient, but it is not the case.

## Game

The game used the mighty Unity. It is a powerful game engine, more simple than its competitors and is always introducing new useful features. Perfect for beginners in games development.
Its direct competitor, Unreal Engine, is probably more powerful than Unity, but is a little bit more complex and as a student I need it to be more easy to understand.

With **Unity** I have a game engine that allow me to do everything as simple as possible: 3D modeling, programming with C#, scripts, audio desing, lighting, etc.
