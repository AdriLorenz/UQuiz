- Apart from that, the game have a consistent theme with the color orange used in all the important parts of it: the game logo, the important letters, important objects, etc.

- The score is shown in screens across all chambers. This is because in VR the user interface must be integrated within the world and not directly in the screen of the player to 
avoid breaking the inmersion that VR brings.

- When grabbing an object in VR, the controller vibration will be activated for an instant to let the player know that the object have been grabbed. This feedback is very important
in VR.

- Next to that, your VR hands will also disappear to make clear that the object have been grabbed.

- If a question is correct, the game will alert you with a sound an green lights

- The same will happen with the incorrect answer. A red light with an error sound will alert the player.

- When the player moves to the next chamber, the door of the old chamber will close. The reason behind that is to guide the player in a natural way and also to optimize the game
allowing it to delete the objects inside the old chamber and disabling all the unused scripts, increasing the performance.

- At the moment the door is going to open, a sound will alert the player that the door is opening. That sound 3D audio to give the player a feedback of the direction of the sound.

- In the options menu the user can select the continuous movement or the teleport movement. This is very useful because the players that suffer from dizziness can enjoy the game
in the teleportation mode, while the players with more VR experience can enjoy it at their own way.
